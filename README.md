# hello-world
This repository is for practicing GitHub flow and cool stuff like that. 

My name is Marcos and I am a computer science major. I work at Paylocity as a supervisor in our Client Service department. I love reading, creating websites, listening to music, writing poetry, and spending time with kids. I am currently exploring an emphasis in machine learning.
